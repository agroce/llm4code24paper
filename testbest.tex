\section{Introduction}


\section{Code Generation: ``Core'' Code vs. Test Code}

The rationale behind our argument that software testing is the most
promising application of current-day LLMs, given their capabiities,
can be most easily understood by examining the difference between
using LLMs to generate ``core'' code (application code that is
executed when the code is deployed:  from the standpoint of testing,
the ``code under test'' (CUT)) and using LLMs to
generate \emph{test code}.  We proceed by examining the possible outcomes of
both tasks.

\subsection{Case 1: Success}

If an LLM generates correct, efficient ``core'' or test code, there is in one sense no
difference: the result is as desired.  However, there is still an
advantage in the case of test code:  it may not be neccessary to have
a human inspect it and determine its validity.  Operational code, in
most important contexts, must be inspected by another human being
before used (even code generated by professional human programmers is
usually subjected to substantial inspection in serious development
efforts).  LLM-generated test cases can be reviewed, of course, as
some human test code is subjected to inspection.  However, test code
can also be used without inspection, as if it were the output of a
fuzzer or automated testing tool, which is only examined if the test
produced fails.

\subsection{Case 2: Obvious Failure}

An LLM may also generate code that is obviously bad, and either fails
to compile (e.g., type system violations) or fails under almost all
runtime conditions.  Such code is, often, correctable to code of case
1 or case 3, with little effort.  In the case of test code, runtime
failures take the form of failing tests that should not fail,
e.g. where the LLM has produced an over-strict or simply incorrect
test oracle.  In these cases, the code can often be corrected by
properly weakening the oracle or by modifying the expected output to
match the real (correct) output of code.  Obvious (in terms of
visibility) failures in non-test code may requires substantially more
debugging effort, but it is reasonable to consider this case one where
neither kind of code generation has an obvious advantage.

\subsection{Case 3: Subtle Failure}

The most dangerous case for LLM-generated code, as with
human-generated code, is that of subtle failure which only exhibits
under rare input conditions.  For ``core'' code the consequences can
be arbitrary; the faulty code may not be detected until it is
deployed, with the usual potentially disastrous consequences and
costs.

A particularly important subtle failure mode of LLM-generated core code is
code that is ``correct'' but \emph{insecure}.  Previous studies have
shown that, like code taken from sources such as stackoverflow,
LLM-code may be prone to taking the ``easy path'' of functionality
without security~\cite{pearce2022asleep,sandoval2023lost,siddiq2023generate}.  Given the
difficulty of testing for insecurity and the cost or impossibility of
``building security in after the fact,'' this can be a particularly
disastrous failure mode, and one that is almost always subtle.  There
is, essentially, no equivalent for this failure mode in test code,
which may fail to check for security, but in general cannot itself
introduce a vulnerability.

In fact, the consequences of rare failure in test code are generally
bounded.  A test is fundamentally either too weak or too strong.  That
is, it either does not fail when it should, or fails when it should
not fail.  The latter case, if subtle and only exposed after some
change to the code under test, is subtle in the sense that it is not
immediately detected, but can only be subtle in the sense that it is
hard to understand as a test failure if it \emph{exposes a complexity
  in the specification of the software.}  In our view, test code that
exposes such a complexity, especially a subtle one, is not a
``failure'' at all, but is instead a \emph{contribution to a software
  development effort}.  No such statement can be made about a subtle
bug in a program.

The remaining case is test code that subtly fails to catch some
erroneous aspects of behavior of the program under test.  However,
this is, essentially, the typical case for all individual tests,
manually or automatically constructed.  ``Core'' code is generally
uniquely responsible for certain behaviors of a program; test code is
generally only partially responsible for detecting flaws in behavior,
in well-designed test efforts.  It is seldom the case that anyone
assumes a particular test is meant to catch all possible faults in a
program, or even in the code it executes.  Therefore, test code that detects at
least some bad behaviors is always useful, and this minimal criteria
can be easily established by using simple, fully automated techniques
such as mutation testing.
